            Hi! My name is Mikhail. And did you know that my name
is a Slavic Origin? It came from a country called Russia or in the ancient times
"Rus". Anyhow, enough with the chit chat. Let me tell you about my hobbies!
            I have a lot of hobbies, when I was 15 years old, I have discovered that
I had a knack for reading and watching history novels. Nonetheless, I also like
coding/scripting some useless stuff. lol. During the pandemic, I was so bored and I didn't know
what to do. So I asked myself; why don't I try to be a game developer? And so I did, I became a game developer
            in a platform called Roblox. I took part in a lot of Game Developer Groups. I also became
a 3D Modeller as a part time commissioner. I would model game objects and characters for the developers and they would
pay me in return. Though, it wasn't real money. But it's still good to have a feeling like you're finally doing something in
this vivid life. And lastly, my favorite hobby. Can you guess what it is?..
            PLAYING GUITAR! Since 7th Grade, I got hooked to music and musical instruments. The first instrument I learned was drums
and then bass and then guitar. To put it simply, I always play guitar whenever I want to because despite the fact that there are a lot of things
going on in my plate. Playing guitar had always made me feel like I'm good at something. I also wrote a little guitar riff. Take a listen below!
